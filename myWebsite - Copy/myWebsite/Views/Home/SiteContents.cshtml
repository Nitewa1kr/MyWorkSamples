                            My perspective on the game has changed since then. What you're reading now, as it happens, is the 52nd weekly column I've written about Dota—a year of writing, representing almost three years of thinking too hard about wizards. Temporal neatness is as good a reason as any to explain the way that thinking has shifted.

            <h5><u>Diablo 3 Reaper Of Souls</u></h5>
            <p>
                Just about every single Diablo III hero has been added to Heroes of the Storm so far. We already have Sonya the Barbarian, Johanna the Crusader, Valla the Demon Hunter, Kharazim the Monk, and Nazeebo the Witch Doctor. While these additions were nice, we were still missing arguably the most important - or self-important - character of all: the Wizard.

            <h5><u>Indie Games</u></h5>
            <p>
                Independent video games (commonly referred to as indie games) are video games created by individuals or small teams generally without video game publisher financial support. Indie games often focus on innovation and rely on digital distribution. Indie gaming has seen a rise in the latter half of the 2000s decade, primarily due to new online distribution methods and development tools. Some games originated as indie have become very successful financially, such as Braid, World of Goo, Flow, and Minecraft.
